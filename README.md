# Book-an-appointment


Patient / Doctor Scheduler - Create a patient class and a doctor class. Have a doctor that can handle multiple patients and setup a scheduling program where a doctor can only handle 16 patients during an 8 hr work day.

The program contains two doctors(Dr. Jill and Dr. Ken). My initial thought is to find a way to store the patient's information with the time of their appointment. First, I created a time slot as a dictionary object. The key is the time and value are the patientâ€™s name. Second, I created a program where one patient is trying to book an appointment for one doctor and store the patients in the time slot. Later, creating a while loop helped me repeat the process to book an appointment for a new patient. I have created a Doctor class because the time slot will be an attribute. Then I can create multiple doctors for the patients to schedule an appointment. This program is not perfect. There is plenty of conditions that can be added.
